# Design patterns cheat sheet

## Creational patterns. 
Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.


## Structural patterns

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.



## Behavioral patterns

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- **[Observer](https://github.com/tmdautov/design-patterns/blob/master/behavioral/observer.ts)** lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.
- **[Strategy](https://github.com/tmdautov/design-patterns/blob/master/behavioral/strategy.ts)** ets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
