# Design patterns cheat sheet
I believe that design patterns helps you to orginise your code better. It's a fundamental knowledges about how to solve most popular problems on your production. It helps you to not reinvent the wheel. 

## Creational patterns. 
Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.


## Structural patterns

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.



## Behavioral patterns

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- **[Observer](https://github.com/tmdautov/design-patterns/blob/master/behavioral/observer.ts)** lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.
- **[Strategy](https://github.com/tmdautov/design-patterns/blob/master/behavioral/strategy.ts)** lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
- **[State](hello)** lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.
